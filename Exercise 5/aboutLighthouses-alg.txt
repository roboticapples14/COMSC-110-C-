1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): Write a program to determine how far away a boat can see a lighthouse at sea. 

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input): 


PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. miles = sqrt(.8 * height)

OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-introduction of objective, author, user instructions/rules
- Prompt for height of lighthouse (in feet)
- Return number of miles it can be seen

DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
-double height
- double miles

3. Algorithm instructions (recipe)
***introduction 
10 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
20 declare double height
30 declare double miles
40 prompt for height of lighthouse in feet
50 store input in height
60 miles = sqrt(.8 * height)
70 format miles
80 ooutput result
999 END

4. Test cases (list purpose of each test case, any input values, and expected results)

Test case #1: height = 30 feet
10 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
20 declare double height
30 declare double miles
40 prompt for height of lighthouse in feet
50 store 30 in height
60 miles = sqrt(.8 * 30)
70 format miles (to 0 decimal points)
80 output "A 30 foot tall lighthouse can be seen from 5 miles away."
999 END

Test case #2: 
10 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
20 declare double height
30 declare double miles
40 prompt for height of lighthouse in feet
50 store 100 in height
60 miles = sqrt(.8 * 100)
70 format miles (to 0 decimal points)
80 output "A 100 foot tall lighthouse can be seen from 9 miles away."
999 END
