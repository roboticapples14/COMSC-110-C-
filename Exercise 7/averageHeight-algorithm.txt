1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): Calculate average height of everyone in the room

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input): 
-Height in inches (repetitively taken from everyone in the room)

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
	1. Output introduction
	2. Input each person's height and simultaniously count each person
	3. Sum their height
	4. Output results

OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
- introduction of objective, author, user instructions/rules
- prompt "What is your height in inches?"
- label "The average height of everyone in the room is: "
- averageAge

DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications): 
- height (integer) = each person's height in inches [valid values: 0-110]
- count (integer) = number of people in the room [valid values: >= 0]
- sum (integer) = sum of all the heights
- averageHeight (decimal) = average height of all the people in the room (sum divided by num of people)

3. Algorithm instructions (recipe)
1 count = 0
2 sum = 0
3 averageHeight = 0
***introduction 
10 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
***Input each person's height and count each person
20 Prompt "What is the height (in inches) of the next person? (enter 0 when no one is left) "
30 Store input as height
40 if height = 0, skip to line 70
50 sum += height
60 count ++
65 Go back to 20
***Calculate the average height
70 averageHeight = sum / count
***Output results
80 output label "The average height of everyone in the room is: "
90 output averageHeight

4. Test cases (list purpose of each test case, any input values, and expected results)

Test case #1: purpose: 3 people are in the room. input values = 60, 70, 80. ageverageAge = 30
1 count = 0
2 sum = 0
3 averageHeight = 0
10 Calculate the average Height of everyone int the room. Author: Natalie
20 Prompt "What is the height (in inches) of the next person? (enter 0 when no one is left) "
30 height = 60
40 height != 0, -> continue
50 sum = 60
60 count = 1
65 Go back to 20
20 Prompt "What is the height (in inches) of the next person? (enter 0 when no one is left) "
30 height = 70
40 height != 0, -> continue
50 sum = 70
60 count = 2
65 Go back to 20
20 Prompt "What is the height (in inches) of the next person? (enter 0 when no one is left) "
30 height = 80
40 height != 0, -> continue
50 sum = 80
60 count = 3
65 Go back to 20
20 Prompt "What is the height (in inches) of the next person? (enter 0 when no one is left) "
30 height = 0
40 height = 0, -> break to line 70
70 averageHeight = 210 / 3 = 70
80 output label "The average height of everyone in the room is: "
90 output 70
999 END

Test case #2: purpose: 0 people are in the room. input values = . ageverageHeight = 0
1 count = 0
2 sum = 0
3 averageHeight = 0
10 Calculate the average Height of everyone int the room. Author: teacher
20 Prompt "What is the height (in inches) of the next person? (enter 0 when no one is left) "
30 height = 0
40 height = 0, -> break to line 70
70 averageHeight = 0/0 --> Runtime error

Test case #3: purpose: 1 person is in the room who's height is 76. input values = 76. ageverageHeight = 0
1 count = 0
2 sum = 0
3 averageHeight = 0

30 height = 0
40 height = 0, -> break to line 70
70 averageAge = 76 / 1 = 76
80 output label "The average age of everyone in the room is: "
90 output 76
