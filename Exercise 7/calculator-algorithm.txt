1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): 4 function calculator

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input): 
- int operator [1 = addition, 2 = subtraction, 3 = multiplication, 4 = division]
- double num1
- double num2

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. Processing desired operator
2. executing calculations based on operator indicated

OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-introduction of objective, author, user instructions/rules
- Output prompt for operator indication: clarify [1 = addition, 2 = subtraction, 3 = multiplication, 4 = division]

DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
- int operator [1 = addition, 2 = subtraction, 3 = multiplication, 4 = division]
- double num1
- double num2
- double result

3. Algorithm instructions (recipe)
***introduction 
10 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
20 output "Enter 1 to add, enter 2 to subtract, enter 3 to multiply, enter 4 to divide. "
30 store input as operator
40 prompt for num1
45 store input in num1
50 prompt for num2
55 store input in num2
60 if operator = 1, skip to 100
70 if operator = 2, skip to line 110
80 if operator = 3, skip to line 120
90 if operator = 4, skip to line 130
100 result = num1 + num2
105 skip to 140
110 result = num1 - num2
115 skip to 140
120 result = num1 * num2
125 skip to 140
130 result = num1 / num2
135 skip to 140
140 output result
150 if continue, go to line 20
999 END

4. Test cases (list purpose of each test case, any input values, and expected results):
Add 10 and 2

10 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
20 output "Enter 1 to add, enter 2 to subtract, enter 3 to multiply, enter 4 to divide. "
30 1 -> add
40 prompt for num1
45 10
50 prompt for num2
55 2
60 operator = 1, skip to 100
100 result = 10 + 2 = 12
140 output 12
150 false -> end
999 END

Test case #2: 
divide 5 by 2, then subtract 40 and 60

10 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
20 output "Enter 1 to add, enter 2 to subtract, enter 3 to multiply, enter 4 to divide. "
30 4 -> divide
40 prompt for num1
45 5
50 prompt for num2
55 2
60 if operator = 1, false
70 if operator = 2, false
80 if operator = 3, false
90 if operator = 4, true -> skip to line 130
130 result = 5 / 2 = 2.5
135 skip to 140
140 output 2.5
150 continue -> go to line 20

20 output "Enter 1 to add, enter 2 to subtract, enter 3 to multiply, enter 4 to divide. "
30 2 -> subtract
40 prompt for num1
45 40
50 prompt for num2
55 60
60 if operator = 1, false
70 if operator = 2, true -> skip to line 110
110 result = 40 - 60 = -20
115 skip to 140
140 output -20
150 continue = false, end
999 END
