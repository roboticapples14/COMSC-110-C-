1. Objective: Calculate number of days between DOB and Due date of project

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data): 
INPUT (any data items to be input): n/a
totalDays = 365 * (dueYear - DOByear) - ((dueYear - DOByear) % 4)
totalDays += 30.42 * (dueMonth - DOBmonth)
totalDays += dueDay - DOBdays


PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. 

OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-introduction of objective, author, user instructions/rules


DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
- int totalDays - initialize at 0
- int DOBmonth - Month that user was born
- int DOBday - Day that user was born
- int DOByear - Year that user was born
- int dueMonth - Month that assignment is due
- int dueDay - day of month that assignment is due
- int dueYear - Year that assignment is due
